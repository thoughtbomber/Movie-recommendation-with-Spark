It is the course project of CS-449 (systems for data science) at École polytechnique fédérale de Lausanne(EPFL). The repository only contains part of the project.

It consists of the following two parts.

* User-based collaborative filtering: Neighbourhood-based personalized recoomendations with KNN, based on the user similarity. 
* Scaling: The algorithm is re-implemented with Breeze, a Numpy-like library to improve efficiency. The calculation can also be scaled on a number of executors.
